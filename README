A FUSE based FAT file system implementation done as the last assignment for Operating Systems course CS111 Spring16

Make compiles 3 executables: 
	createdisk, myfilesys and read-img

Create the disk image using:
	./createdisk diskname.img size(in blocks)

Mount the FUSE filesystem using:
	sudo ./myfilesys mountfolder


A disk image reading tool that used (direct reference to code at 
http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/pjd/cs7600-s10/Homework_4_-_due_4-16_01.html)
is called read-img. To run this, you run the following commands:
	./read-img diskname.img


FUSE functionality limited, but it is related more so to FUSE functions being linked with the code incorrectly rather than non-functional disk operations performed by the code.
